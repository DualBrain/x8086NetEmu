INTRODUCTION
------------
Haven't you always wanted to try the first version of DOS? Maybe not,
but I became interested when I read that all 1.x versions of DOS came
with a game called DONKEY.BAS. The game in question was written by
Bill Gates and Neil Konzen - as you can see, IBM was pretty desperate
for things to include with DOS.

CONTENTS OF ARCHIVE
-------------------
This archive (TK-DOS11.ZIP) contains:

        TK-DOS11.TXT (This file)
        TK-DOS11.DIM (The DOS v1.10 image file)
        DIM14A  .ZIP (Disk Image Archiver)
        DONKEYQB.BAS (DONKEY.BAS converted to QBasic format)

INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT DOS v1.10
---------------------------------
 - There are no volume labels.
 - The MKDIR/MD, CHDIR/CD, and RMDIR/RD commands
   don't work because directories are not supported!
 - BASIC.COM and BASICA.COM will not work on most 486s
   and above; this is because they're looking for
   certain ROM chips that do not exist in modern computers.
 - The BASIC programs that come with DOS v1.10 can be run
   with GW-BASIC, which is available on the web.
 - You must boot with a 5-1/4" drive, the image extractor
   will turn the disk into a 160k floppy.
 - Hard drives cannot be accessed with DOS v1.10

HOW TO MAKE A DOS v1.10 BOOT DISK
---------------------------------
Note: You *must* extract the image to a 5-1/4" floppy disk!

      If your 5-1/4" drive is not your A: drive, many computers
      support switching drive letters within the BIOS. Check
      your manufacturer's documentation for details.

      If this method is unavailable to you, your floppy drive
      cable can be switched inside your computer. The drive
      connected to the end of the floppy cable is always A:,
      and the drive connected to the middle of the floppy
      cable is always B:.

 1. Extract DIM14A.ZIP to the directory that contains TK-DOS11.DIM
 2. Use DIM to uncompress the image file.
    Example: DIM -r A: TK-DOS11.DIM
    This will extract the image to the A: drive.
